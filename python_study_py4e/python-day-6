# tuples examples !!! 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

# x = (1, 2, 3, 4)
# x [2] = 2

# tuples feature: assignment variables to vales inside tuple
# (x, y) = (13, 17)
# print(y)

# sorting of the given dictioanary (reverse here is only for from > to <)
# c = {'a': 12, 'b': 82, 'c': 59, 'd': 74}
# print(sorted([(v, k) for k, v in c.items()], reverse=True))
